        3.  Rewrite the article to naturally integrate the keywords mentioned in the report, aiming for a healthy density (e.g., 1-2%). Do NOT stuff keywords; weave them in smoothly.
        4.  Improve the sentence structure and flow to enhance readability.
        5.  Maintain the core message, tone, and structure of the original draft.
